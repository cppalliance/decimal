== User Configurable Macros

The following configuration macros are available:

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_CASSERT`: Disables the use of `<cassert>` and all run-time assertions.

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_IOSTREAM`: Disables the use of I/O streaming and removes all associated headers (e.g. `<iostream>`, `<iosfwd>`, `<cwchar>`, etc.)

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DISABLE_CLIB`: Defines both of the above macros. In testing this reduces ROM usage by ~50%.

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_ALLOW_IMPLICIT_CONVERSIONS`: Allows a binary floating-point type (e.g. `double`) to be implicitly converted to a decimal floating point type.
This option is not recommended, but can be useful if you want to use specific functionality from the standard library with internal conversions such as:

[source, c++]
----
constexpr decimal64 half {5, -1};
std::complex<decimal64> test_val {half, half};
const auto res = std::acos(test_val);
----

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_FAST_MATH` performs optimizations similar to that of the `-ffast-math` compiler flag such as removing all checks for non-finite values.
This flag increases the performance of the basis operations (e.g. add, sub, mul, div, and comparisons) by up to 20%.

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_DEC_EVAL_METHOD`: See <cfloat> section for explanation

== Automatic Configuration Macros

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_CXX20_CONSTEXPR`: This is defined to `constexpr` when compiling with C++20 or greater, otherwise it expands to nothing.

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_CONSTEXPR`: This is defined to `constexpr` when any of the following are met:
  * _MSC_FULL_VER >= 192528326
  * __GNUC__ >= 9
  * Compiler has: __builtin_is_constant_evaluated()
  * C++20 support with: std::is_constant_evaluated()

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_HAS_STD_CHARCONV`: This macro is defined if header `<charconv>` exists and the language standard used is >= C++17
  * We only need the structs and enums out of the header so we are not concerned with being overly restrictive about the feature test macros.
    ** Known compilers that support this lighter  requirement are: GCC >= 10, Clang >= 13, and MSVC >= 14.2

- `BOOST_DECIMAL_HAS_STD_STRING_VIEW`: This macro is defined if header `<string_view>` exists and the langauge standard used is >= C++17
