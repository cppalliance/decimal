== Description

Boost.Decimal is an implementation of https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/754/6210/[IEEE 754] and https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2009/n2849.pdf[ISO/IEC DTR 24733] Decimal Floating Point numbers.
The library is header-only, has no dependencies, and requires C++14.

== Motivation

Current C++ floating point types store the significand (often incorrectly referred to as the mantissa) as binary digits.
Famously this leads to representation errors: https://0.30000000000000004.com.
Decimal floating point numbers avoid this issue by storing the significand in base-10 (decimal).
The other major difference between binary and decimal floating point types is that the latter allows for multiple representations of the same number.
For example 1e5 could also be stored as 0.1e6, 0.01e7, so on and so forth.
These are referred to as cohorts which binary does not have as there is only one way to represent each number in binary floating point.

== Use Cases

The use case for Decimal Floating Point numbers is where rounding errors are significantly impactful such as finance.
In applications where integer or fixed-point arithmetic are used to combat this issue Decimal Floating Point numbers can provide a significantly greater range of values.
For example, while a fixed-point representation that allocates 8 decimal digits and 2 decimal places can represent the numbers 123456.78, 8765.43, 123.00, and so on, a floating-point representation with 8 decimal digits could also represent 1.2345678, 1234567.8, 0.000012345678, 12345678000000000, and so on.

== Supported Compilers

Boost.Decimal is tested natively on Ubuntu (x86_64, s390x, and aarch64), macOS (x86_64, and Apple Silicon), and Windows (x32 and x64);
as well as emulated PPC64LE and STM32 using QEMU with the following compilers:

* GCC 7 and later
* Clang 6 and later
* Visual Studio 2017 and later
* Intel OneAPI DPC++

Tested on https://github.com/cppalliance/decimal/actions[Github Actions] and https://drone.cpp.al/cppalliance/decimal[Drone].
