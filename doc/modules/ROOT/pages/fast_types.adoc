:idprefix: fast_types_

Now that we have seen the three basic types as specified in IEEE-754 there are three additional adjacent types: `decimal32_fast`, `decimal64_fast`, and `decimal128_fast`.
These types yield identical computational results, but with ~3x faster performance.
These types make the classic tradeoff of space for time as they require more storage width than the IEEE 754 conformant type.
