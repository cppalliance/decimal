IEEE 754 defines 5 rounding modes for Decimal Floating Point Types.

1. Downward
2. To nearest (with ties to even)
3. To nearest from zero
4. Toward zero
5. Upward

NOTE: The default rounding mode is to nearest with ties to even (#2) as specified in IEEE 754 Section 4.3.3

IMPORTANT: The rounding mode can only be changed at runtime. All `constexpr` calculations will use the default of to nearest from zero.

Prior to v5.2.0 this header was `<boost/decimal/fenv.hpp>`, but has been changed to `<boost/decimal/cfenv.hpp>` for consistency with the STL.
